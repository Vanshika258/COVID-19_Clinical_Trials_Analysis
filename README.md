# COVID-19_Clinical_Trials_Analysis

🧪 COVID-19 Clinical Trials Analysis — Summary

This project explores global COVID-19 clinical trials data using Python and Pandas. The goal is to clean and analyze the dataset, understand the distribution of trials, identify trends in study phases, interventions, and sponsoring organizations, and reveal insights about how research efforts evolved during the pandemic. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and meaningful visualizations to uncover patterns in clinical research.
